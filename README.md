## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
A project to give real time feedback on pitch tendency to musicians.
I'm looking for help getting the backend set up with AWS. 

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: 
Send an email to me at BrassWiz@Virtuosic.org if you'd like to help out or offer some advice. 

- âš¡ Fun fact: 
I've been a musician for almost 20 years now. I started playing my instrument my freshman year of highschool and ended up going to college for it. I work in Finance now, but am working on the first small step(tuner app) in a big journey to create a community space for musicians. I know very little about coding and am open to feedback and instruction!
